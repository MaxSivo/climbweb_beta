# Moonboard Climbing Grade Prediction and Generation

## Overview

In this project, we implement a custom transformer model to predict climbing grades on the **Moonboard**, an 18x11 grid composed of fixed holds used by rock climbers for training. We designed a graph-based approach where **active holds are represented as nodes**, and edges between them are defined by a distance metric representing a climber's maximum reach (wingspan). This structure forms the basis for our **hold embeddings**, which we call **"hold2vec"**â€”a method analogous to Word2Vec, where each hold (node) is predicted based on its neighboring holds (context).

### Steps

1. **Graph Structure & Embedding ("hold2vec")**:
   - We represent each hold as a node, and edges connect holds that are within a reachable distance for a climber.
   - Using the context of connected holds, we predict each hold (node), generating a vector embedding for each Moonboard hold.
   - When visualized in 3D space, these embeddings closely resemble the physical Moonboard layout.

2. **Custom Transformer**:
   - After generating the embeddings using "hold2vec", we expand their dimensionality using a fully connected neural network.
   - The expanded embeddings are then passed through a **custom transformer model** built using **PyTorch**.
   - Our model outperforms traditional machine learning models (e.g., fully connected networks, GNNs, and RNNs).

3. **Climb Classification Website**:
   - We developed a **website** using **Docker**, **Flask**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for model hosting, with a front-end built in **React**.
   - Users can input a sequence of holds on the Moonboard, and our model will classify it into a **climbing grade**.

4. **Climb Generation**:
   - We also developed an algorithm for **climb generation** based on a specific grade using a **Markov Chain with Monte Carlo sampling**.
   - Given a grade, the algorithm generates a sequence of holds to form a complete climb. The climb is validated by our classification model to ensure the correct grade.
   - The climb generation feature is also available on our website under the **"Climb Generation"** section.
